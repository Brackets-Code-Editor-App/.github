## About Brackets
Brackets represents a modern, open-source text editor specifically designed for web design and front-end development, with a focus on visual tools and workflows that bridge the gap between code and design. Developed initially by Adobe and now maintained by the open-source community, Brackets challenges traditional code editor conventions by providing features that understand the interconnected nature of web technologies. The editor's clean, uncluttered interface and innovative tools make it particularly well-suited for designers who code and developers who value visual feedback during the creation process.

The desktop application delivers a specialized development environment for both macOS and Windows platforms, featuring a powerful code editor built on web technologies with quick project switching, smart code hinting, and built-in file system navigation. Brackets' unique Live Preview feature establishes a connection with Chrome to display real-time changes without saving or refreshing, while its Extract tool allows developers to pull information like colors, fonts, and measurements directly from PSD files. With support for preprocessor languages like LESS and SCSS, integration with Theseus for JavaScript debugging, and a vibrant extension ecosystem, Brackets continues to serve as a compelling choice for web professionals seeking a focused, visually-oriented coding experience.
